INFRA: Create a Chrome extension from the WebRTC SIP client application. Consider manifest.json, permissions, and other necessary configurations.:CHECKPOINT:2,5,7

UX: Reduce the length of the window by 25%.:CHECKPOINT:36
UX: Remove the dividers.:CHECKPOINT:36
UX: Reduce the section margins by 10px.:CHECKPOINT:37
UX: Reduce the windows length by 25%.:CHECKPOINT:37

INFRA: On inbound call, if the remote side cancels during ring/trying, a 487 [ORIGINATOR_CANCEL] packet is sent back to the phone but the ringing audio continues to play after the call shows ended. It should stop playing on call ended.:CHECKPOINT:79,80
UX: The answer button remains active after an inbound call is ended with 487 [ORIGINATOR_CANCEL]. It should be disabled because there is no inbound call to answer. Failed to answer: No incoming call to answer:CHECKPOINT:81

UX: Add icons for the 48 and 128 sizes, use them instead of the 16 size.:CHECKPOINT:129
UX: Call log feature should be added to keep a history of calls made and received. A timestamp, call direction, and call duration should be displayed in the call log tab.:CHECKPOINT:132
UX: It is not easily apparent which direction the call in the call log was going. Add text for inbound and outbound calls.:CHECKPOINT:135
UX: It appears outbound calls do not show in the call log.:CHECKPOINT:135,136,137,138
UX: It appears that cancelled calls show in the log as completed.:CHECKPOINT:135
UX: Incoming calls that are rejected/hung up are shown as completed, they should be shown as rejected.:CHECKPOINT:140
UX: Incoming calls that were answered are showing as missed in the call log.:CHECKPOINT:141
UX: Inbound calls that are rejected are incorrectly labeled as missed, and inbound calls that are answered are not showing as completed.:CHECKPOINT:142,143
UX: Incoming calls that are hung up locally still show as missed, with a ReferenceError in the console.:CHECKPOINT:144
UX: Incoming calls are being shown in the call log twice - first as missed, incorrectly and second as rejected correctly.:CHECKPOINT:145
UX: Outgoing calls that get hung up or cancelled by the local user are incorrectly labeled as rejected in the call log.:CHECKPOINT:147
UX: Remove Call History header and dividers from the call log tab.:CHECKPOINT:154
UX: Reduce the number of lines in each call log entry display, for example put the call status on the same line as the other info. Also use a blue colour instead of red for incoming calls.:CHECKPOINT:155
UX: Add functionality to the call log to add a clickable phone icon next to the call log entry that will populate the phone tab destination and make a call to the number that was in the call log entry.:CHECKPOINT:156


#STATUS:PENDING:


#STATUS:NEW:
INFRA: Hold functionality is needed. There should be functions for this in SIP.js documentation but a hold button needs to be created and displayed once a call is up.

INFRA: Mute functionality is needed. There should be functions for this in SIP.js documentation but a mute button needs to be created and displayed once a call is up. This should mute the microphone and speaker.

UX: Make browser notifications a setting that can be enabled and disabled. It should be at the bottom of the settings tab under the disconnect button.

UX: Call transfers need to be implemented. There should be functions for this in SIP.js documentation but a transfer button needs to be created and displayed once a call is up.

INFRA: DTMF functions need to be added. There should be a DTMF button that can be clicked to send DTMF tones. Ask any questions that could elaborate and clarify implementation of this feature.

INFRA: Click to call recognition of telephone numbers in the browser web pages needs to be implemented whereby a phone number recognized in any web page is made clickable and when clicked, it will populate the phone tab destination and make a call to the number.

INFRA: Console logging can be removed and all code that uses it can be removed.

INFRA: Make state stored data properly secured because it includes user name, password and server information.
INFRA: Make the web socket communication secure so that it is not vulnerable to MITM attacks because it includes user name and password.

INFRA: Review all the logic for any potential refactoring to simplify the code and reduce complexity and duplication.
INFRA: Investigate any potential performance improvements.
INFRA: Investigate for any potential security improvements.
INFRA: Add automated tests for the extension functionality.
INFRA: Package the extension for distribution

INFRA: Update the augment-README file to reflect the current state of the project. This file is not for end user documentation but for developers and contributors to understand the project, its features, directory structure, prerequisites, installation, configuration details, usage, key files and key functions. It should provide useful information to any other AI/LLM to be able to start developing it by just reading the README file.

INFRA: Manifest version 2 is deprecated, and support will be removed in 2024. See https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline for details.:CHECKPOINT:47,48,49,50,51,53,54
INFRA: Unchecked runtime.lastError: Unable to download all specified images. background.html:0 (anonymous function):CHECKPOINT:47
INFRA: Permission '*://*/*' is unknown.:CHECKPOINT:48
INFRA: Connection error: ReferenceError: SIP is not defined:CHECKPOINT:49
INFRA: Connection error: ReferenceError: window is not defined:CHECKPOINT:50
INFRA: Call failed: MediaStream is not defined:CHECKPOINT:51
INFRA: SessionDescriptionHandler.getDescription failed - Error: Media devices not available in insecure contexts:CHECKPOINT:53
INFRA: TypeError: this._peerConnection.getReceivers is not a function:CHECKPOINT:54

BUG: Error: Microphone access denied. Microphone and speaker access is required for making and receiving calls.

#STATUS: PARKED:
UX: Add settings input boxes for the STUN servers that are present in the peerConnectionConfiguration. Autofill with stun:stun.l.google.com:19302.


#STATUS: BROKEN:
UX: Outbound calls that get rejected/hung up during ringing/trying are being incorrectly labeled as no answer.:CHECKPOINT:146
UX: Outbound calls that are rejected or hung up by the remote party are incorrectly labeled as no answer in the call log.:CHECKPOINT:148,151
UX: SIP 480 Temporarily Unavailable responses from remote party are incorrectly logged as no answer instead of unavailable.:CHECKPOINT:152,153

INFRA: On inbound call, when the remote side hangs up, the phone tab UI does not update with the appropriate call ended status. On outbound call, when the remote side hangs up, the phone tab UI does correctly update with the call ended status. Investigate how these two scenarios are different and fix the inbound call hangup:CHECKPOINT:102,103,105,118

INFRA: On outbound call, once the remote side answers, I press hangup but the phone hangup does not reach the remote side to end the call. The BYE packet does not get sent and is not seen by the connecting SIP server. This is not the case with an inbound call where if I press hangup the remote side gets it and ends the call on their side. This is also not the case while the call is ringing, whereby if I press hangup the remote side gets it and ends the call on their side.CHECKPOINT:105,106,107,111,116,121
