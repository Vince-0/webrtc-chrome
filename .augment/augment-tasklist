#STATUS:COMPLETE:
WORKFLOW: Read the files in the .augment folder: augment-guidlienes, augment-tasklist. Explain what you understand about the guidelines for the workflow for this project.:CHECKPOINT:1
INFRA: Create a Chrome extension from the WebRTC SIP client application. Consider manifest.json, permissions, and other necessary configurations.:CHECKPOINT:2,5,7


#STATUS:PENDING:
INFRA: The extension's state and actions should be stored in the Chrome storage API. This will allow the extension to remember the user's settings and connection state across browser sessions:CHECKPOINT:10,12,13,14
INFRA: Introduce console logging for the simple user functions to help troubleshooting call button functions like hangup, answer, reject.:CHECKPOINT:15
BUG: On incoming call, the BYE packet isn't resulting in a call status update:CHECKPOINT:16,18
BUG: Extension not recognizing incoming INVITE messages:CHECKPOINT:17
BUG: Hangup closes the extension and does not execute the BYE packet until reopening:CHECKPOINT:19
BUG: Hangup does not seem to be sending the hangup packet and the switch isn't seeing any BYE packets:CHECKPOINT:19

#STATUS:NEW:
UX: Persist password
UX: Autofill copy the SIP Server string to the WebsocketURL domain so it is not necessary to type it in.
UX: Add a settings page to the extension for configuring all the Connection Settings and Media permissions. This page should replace the current Connection Settings section in the main window.
BUG: Error: Microphone access denied. Microphone and speaker access is required for making and receiving calls.
UX: Add more extension icons (48px and 128px versions)
UX: Implement proper error handling and notifications in the extension
INFRA: Package the extension for distribution
INFRA: Add automated tests for the extension functionality
BUG: This extension includes the key file '\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\administrator\DEV\chrome-webrtc\certs\key.pem'. You probably don't want to do that.
